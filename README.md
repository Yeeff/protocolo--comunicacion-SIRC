# protocolo--comunicacion-SIRC
Implementación del protocolo SIRC de Sony para comunicación infrarroja por microcontroladores. 

Sony has long developed a pulse width serial control protocol, which uses for wired serial control of its devices, 
the SIRC (Serial InfraRed Control) protocol is nothing more than its adaptation to infrared.

With the transmitter and receiver algorithm, what is achieved is to implement the sirc protocol to achieve 
communication with the help of two microcontrollers and infrared leds.
